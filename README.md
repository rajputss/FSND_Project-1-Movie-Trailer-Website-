Project 1 Movie Trailer Website for Fullstack Web Developer Nanodegree

This project shows server-side code storing a list of few of my favorite movies. It also includes box art imagery for the movies
and shows that movie's trailer URL. It serves this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the 
trailers.

It has two classes fresh_tomatoes and media. The project also has following modules:
